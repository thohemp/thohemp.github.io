abstract: Eye contact is a crucial non-verbal interaction modality and plays an important role in our everyday social life. While humans are very sensitive to eye contact, the capabilities of machines to capture a personâ€™s gaze are still mediocre. We tackle this challenge and present NITEC, a hand-annotated eye contact dataset for ego-vision interaction. NITEC exceeds existing datasets for ego-vision eye contact in size and variety of demographics, social contexts, and lighting conditions, making it a valuable resource for advancing ego-vision-based eye contact research. Our extensive evaluations on NITEC demonstrate strong cross-dataset performance, emphasizing its effectiveness and adaptability in various scenarios, that allows seamless utilization to the fields of computer vision, human-computer interaction, and social robotics. We make our NITEC dataset publicly available to foster reproducibility and further exploration in the field of ego-vision interaction.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: We present NITEC, a comprehensive hand-annotated eye contact dataset for ego-vision interaction, surpassing existing datasets in size, demographic variety, social contexts, and lighting conditions, and demonstrating strong cross-dataset performance for advancing research in computer vision, human-computer interaction, and social robotics, with public availability to foster further exploration.
