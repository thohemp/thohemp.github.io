        I am currently working on visual estimators in complex logistics environment to improve automization process and enhance coordination in cluttered warehouse situations.

        ### Pallet Detection

        Pallets are a cruicial component in todays logistics to transport and store any kind of goods. To load and unload pallets safely, transport vehicels must accurately align themselves with the target pallet.
        A precice image based 3D pallet detection and localization enables robots to approach, load and unload autonomously without human aid, facilitating the automatization in cluttered and fast changing warehouse. 

        ### Dataset curation

        For learning based method, the use of adequate data is crucial to archieve accurate and robust detection rates. Unfortunately, datasets for 3D object detections remain rare because of its challenging and time consuming annotation procedures. 
        As a work around, generating synthetic data is a promising approach, as it enables creating a large amount of data with automatically generated annotations. The following images shows data samples that has been generated using NVIDIA Omniverse Replicator, a framework for developing custom synthetic data generation pipelines and services.
           
        ![img](/images/dataset.svg)
        *Synthetic data samples*

        ### Model training 
        Using synthetic data comes with the challenge called the *domain gap* that refers to the models decreased perfomance on real data when the model has only seen synthetic data while training. This gap arises because synthetic data, despite being meticulously crafted, often fails to capture all the nuances and complexities of real-world data. While there are multiple methods to reduce the domain gap, the most common approach is aggressive domain randomization, where a variety of alterations ire introduced into the synthetic data to make the model robust to variations it might encounter in real data.
        Combined with a lot of data augmnetation during the training process, the models might start predicting real world pallets with strong accuracy. The following video shows the predictions of a model training on 120k samples of synthetic data.

        {{< /rawhtml >}}

        ### Outlook
        Next steps involve introducing loaded pallets, which bring the additional challenge of strong occlusion. More details about the data, the model architectures and training pipeling with be released a long a publication in the near future.
