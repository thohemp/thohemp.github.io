I am a research fellow and Phd student at the [NIT group](https://nit.ovgu.de/) of the Otto von Guericke
University Magdeburg, Germany. My research focus is computer vision solution for human-robot interaction, logistics and other industrial applications.

Currently, I am working on image-based solutions to enhance the capabilities of autonomous mobile robots in complex, cluttered warehouse environments. The goal is to achieve higher-level context information and improve intuitive human-robot interaction. This project is part of the AutoKoWaT initiative. ([AutoKoWaT](/project/autokowat/)).
