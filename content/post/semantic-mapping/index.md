# SLAM 

Slam, or Simultaneous Localization and Mapping, is a crucial feature of mobile robotics and plays a significant role in the collision-free navigation and mapping capabilities of robots. It is a technique that allows robots to map their surroundings and determine their own position within that map in real-time. This ability is essential for robots to perform tasks autonomously and navigate through unknown or dynamic environments.

# Semantic SLAM

Semantic SLAM is a technology that combines the traditional SLAM system with semantic information to create a more accurate and detailed map of an environment. By incorporating semantic information, such as object recognition and classification, into the SLAM process, the system can not only build a map of the environment but also understand the objects and their relationships within it. This allows for more intelligent and efficient navigation and interaction with the environment by robots or other autonomous systems.
