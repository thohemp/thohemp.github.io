# RoboAssist 

The goal of RoboAssist is to research methods that enable a mobile robot system to autonomously navigate outdoor environments, identify potential and specific interaction partners, recognize their readiness to interact, interact with them, and track the interaction partners in dense spaces to maintain cooperation through motion analysis.

The scientific and technical challenge lies in capturing the mobile robot's environment in such a way that precise self-localization and, based on that, efficient navigation in an outdoor environment to find cooperating individuals can be achieved. This should be done with minimal reliance on prior information about the robot's surroundings, such as markers. The robot should rely solely on its own optical system to perceive and navigate an initially unknown environment.

# Objectives:

The scientific objectives include the research and testing of real-time capable deep learning algorithms for:

- Environment detection and navigation with SLAM algorithms (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping),
- Motion estimation of dynamic objects and user tracking in dense spaces,
- Person recognition and identification in dense spaces, and
- Detecting interaction readiness based on body and head pose as well as facial features.
- Another scientific objective is to design the algorithms in such a way that a joint optimization of the respective sub-goals can be achieved through end-to-end learning."
